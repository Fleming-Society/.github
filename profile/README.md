 # Introduction

Hi All,

This is the page for the Fleming Society! 

We are the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Departmental Society at UCL, we do all sorts of EEE related projects. The past project we had held includes:
- Outreach STEM projects to the six-formers
- After school club (now Project X)

- 4 Degrees-of-Freedom Robotic Arm with Configurable Claw (We are currently documenting this project, the documentation will be put on as soon as we finish)

# Future projects:

- Audio Amplifier workshop in collaboration with KEF
- LiDAR automonous robot project
