Hi, I’m @Junzhe-Chen

I am an undergraduate at UCL, majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. Also, I am the President of the UCL Fleming Society, which runs some engaging EEE project workshops and hackathons.

I’m interested in Analog Circuit Design, PCB design and Embedded Systems. Sometimes I do some MATLAB programs to help with my labwork and research. Some of my projects include:
- Fully Discrete Analog PWM Modulator with Adjustable Frequency
- TPA3116-based Class D Audio Amplifier
- Cross Bias Referenced Class G Amplifier
- MATLAB Instrument Control Program that reads and analyse data directly from the scope

I am still relatively new to GitHub, but I will slowly put those projects on and make them fully open-source.

I’m currently learning Python, Embedded C and Verilog. Also, I am learning some essential website development and collaborating with my friends to build a website for the Fleming Society. I will leave a link once the domain and host server are ready.
