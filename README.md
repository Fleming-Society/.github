Hi, I’m @Junzhe-Chen

I am currently an undergraduate student at UCL, major in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. Also, I am the President of UCL Fleming Society, which runs some interesting EEE project workshops and hackathons

I’m interested in Analog Circuit Design, PCB design and Embedded System. Sometimes I do some MATLAB program to help with my labworks and research Some of my projects includes:
- Fully Discrete Analog PWM Modulator with Adjustable Frequency
- TPA3116 based Class D Audio Amplifier
- Cross Bias Referenced Class G Amplifier
- MATLAB Instrument Control Program that read and analyse data directly from the scope

I am still quite new to GitHub, but I will put those projects on and make them fully open source slowly.

I’m currently learning Python, Embedded C and Verilog. Also, I am learning some basic website development and cllaborating with my friends to build a website for the Fleming Society. I will leave a link once we get the domain and the host server ready.
