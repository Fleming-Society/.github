Hi, I’m Junzhe Chen

I'm an undergraduate at UCL, majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. Also, I am the President of the UCL Fleming Society, which runs some engaging EEE project workshops and hackathons.

I’m interested in Analog Circuit Design, PCB design and Embedded Systems. Sometimes I do some MATLAB programs to help with my labwork and research. Some of my projects include:
- [Fully Discrete Analog PWM Modulator with Adjustable Frequency](https://github.com/Junzhe-Chen/PWM-Modulator-Circuit)
  - [MATLAB PWM Modulator](https://github.com/Junzhe-Chen/PWM-modulator-demo)
- Breadboard size obstacle avoiding car (ongoing)
- [TPA3116-based Class D Audio Amplifier](https://oshwlab.com/jc040226/tpa3116-amplifier)
- Cross Bias Referenced Class G Amplifier
- MATLAB Instrument Control Program that reads and analyse data directly from the scope

I am still relatively new to GitHub, but I will slowly put those projects on and make them fully open-source.

I’m currently learning Python, Embedded C and Verilog. Also, I am learning some essential website development and collaborating with my friends to build a website for the Fleming Society. I will leave a link once the domain and host server are ready.
